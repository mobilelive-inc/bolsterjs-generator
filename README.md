# bolsterJS-generator

This is a proof of concept of a microfrontend application/container generation cli

## Usage

This package simply exports an interface that takes a log function and arguments from the cli and parses it.

The entry point is through [bolsterjs](https://github.com/mobilelive-inc/bolsterjs) package.
